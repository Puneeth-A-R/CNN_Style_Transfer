# How_to_do_style_transfer_in_tensorflow

##Overview

A convolutional neural network to tranfer styles from one image to another.
This project uses a convolutional neural network based on the pre-trained VGG16 convolutional network that won the ImageNet competition in 2014 for image classification to transfer the style of a given image to another. [This](https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06576) is the original paper on the topic.
